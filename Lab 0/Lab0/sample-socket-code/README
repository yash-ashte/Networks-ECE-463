The folder contains two network applications:

    1. A file transfer application over TCP: server transfers an image file to client, which is displayed on the terminal.

    2. A DNS application using UDP: client sends the domain name to server and server returns back IP(s).

To run these programs do the following:

    1. ./compile.sh — this will create 4 binaries: dns_udp_server, dns_udp_client, file_transfer_tcp_server, file_transfer_tcp_client

    2. Run the server as ./file_transfer_tcp_server OR ./dns_udp_server

    3. Run the client as ./file_transfer_tcp_client [IP address of server] OR ./dns_udp_client [IP address of server]
       If server and client are running on the same machine, just use “localhost” or "127.0.0.1" as server IP address.
